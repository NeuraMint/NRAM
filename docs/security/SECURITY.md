## Security Overview

NeuraMint prioritizes the security of our users' data, assets, and interactions. Our security approach includes:

- Regular third-party security audits
- Bug bounty programs
- Comprehensive testing procedures
- Security-focused development practices
- Encrypted data storage and transmission
- Multi-layered security architecture

## Security Layers

NeuraMint's security is structured in multiple layers:

1. **User-Level Security**:
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Wallet-based cryptographic authentication
   - Private key management (never stored on our servers)
   - Session timeout and token expiration

2. **Application-Level Security**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling without information leakage

3. **Network-Level Security**:
   - TLS/SSL for all connections
   - DDoS protection
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - IP-based access controls for admin functions

4. **Blockchain-Level Security**:
   - Audited smart contracts
   - Formal verification for critical components
   - Multi-signature authorization for admin functions
   - Time-locked contract upgrades
   - Circuit breakers for critical operations

5. **Infrastructure-Level Security**:
   - Server hardening
   - Regular security patches
   - Role-based access control
   - Intrusion detection systems
   - Regular penetration testing

## Data Protection

### Neural Data Privacy

NeuraMint is committed to protecting neural data privacy with multiple safeguards:

1. **Edge Processing**: Raw neural signals are processed on the user's device whenever possible, with only derived fingerprints transmitted to our servers.

2. **Consent-Based Sharing**: Users explicitly control which neural patterns are captured and stored as NFTs.

3. **Encrypted Storage**: All neural data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

4. **Minimal Data Collection**: We adhere to data minimization principles, collecting only what is necessary for platform functionality.

5. **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers are separated from neural data to prevent direct associations.

### Data Retention

- Raw neural data is never permanently stored on our servers
- Neural fingerprints are stored indefinitely as they form the basis of NFTs
- User account data is retained until account deletion
- Authentication logs are kept for 90 days for security purposes

### User Control

Users maintain control over their data:
- Option to delete account and associated data
- Ability to revoke platform access to wallet
- Control over public visibility of owned memories
- Export functionality for personal data

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you've found a security issue in NeuraMint, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

2. **Submit a Report**: Send a detailed report to [security@neuramint.tech](mailto:security@neuramint.tech) including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any supporting materials (screenshots, proof of concept)

3. **Encrypted Communication**: For sensitive reports, use our PGP key available at [neuramint.tech/security-pgp.txt](https://www.neuramint.tech/security-pgp.txt).

4. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours and provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.

## Security Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. **Confirmation**: Our security team will verify the vulnerability.

2. **Assessment**: We will assess its potential impact and develop a fix.

3. **Resolution**: We will implement and test a fix.

4. **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will:
   - Notify affected users if necessary
   - Update our security documentation
   - Credit the reporter (if desired)
   - Publish a security advisory (for significant issues)

5. **Post-Mortem**: We conduct a post-mortem analysis to prevent similar issues.

## Smart Contract Security

Our Solana programs undergo rigorous security measures:

### Development Practices

- Peer code reviews for all smart contract changes
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Static analysis tools for code quality
- Use of proven design patterns
- Explicit handling of edge cases

### Auditing Process

All smart contracts undergo multiple security reviews:

1. **Internal Audit**: By our security engineering team
2. **External Audit**: By independent security firms
3. **Formal Verification**: For critical contract logic

### Deployment Safeguards

- Tiered deployment strategy (testnet â†’ mainnet)
- Phased rollout for major features
- Time-delayed upgrades for critical functions
- Circuit breakers to pause operations if anomalies detected

### Current Audits

Our smart contracts have been audited by:
- [Audit Firm 1] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Audit Firm 2] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)

Audit reports are available at [neuramint.tech/security/audits](https://www.neuramint.tech/security/audits).

## Security FAQs

**Q: How is my wallet secured?**  
A: NeuraMint never stores your private keys. We use non-custodial wallet connections where you maintain complete control of your keys.

**Q: Is my neural data safe?**  
A: Raw neural data is processed locally on your device whenever possible. Only derived neural fingerprints used for NFT creation are transmitted to our servers, and these are encrypted in transit and at rest.

**Q: How are smart contracts secured?**  
A: All smart contracts undergo rigorous internal review, external security audits, and comprehensive testing before deployment.

**Q: What happens if there's a security breach?**  
A: We have a detailed incident response plan that includes containment, investigation, resolution, and notification of affected users according to applicable regulations.

**Q: Can others access my memories without permission?**  
A: No. Your memory NFTs are controlled by your wallet. Only memories you explicitly list in the marketplace or make public are visible to others.
