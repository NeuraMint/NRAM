## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What types of BCI devices are supported?**
A: NeuraMint currently supports EMOTIV EPOC X, EMOTIV Insight, Muse 2, Muse S, and OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV. We regularly add support for new devices.

**Q: How are memory quality tiers determined?**
A: Memory quality is determined by a combination of neural signal complexity, pattern uniqueness, and validation scores. The algorithm analyzes over 20 different neural parameters to assign quality tiers.

**Q: Can I transfer my memories to another wallet?**
A: Yes, memories are standard Solana NFTs and can be transferred to any compatible wallet. From your collection, select a memory and use the "Transfer" function.

**Q: How much NRAM do I need to become a validator?**
A: The minimum stake requirement is 1,000 NRAM tokens. Higher stakes unlock higher validator tiers with better reward rates.

**Q: Are my neural data kept private?**
A: Your raw neural data never leaves your device. Only the processed neural fingerprint and associated metadata are stored on the blockchain. You control the privacy settings for each memory you create.

**Q: How are validation rewards calculated?**
A: Validation rewards are based on several factors including your stake amount, validator tier, accuracy rate, and the number of validations completed. The base reward rate is published in the Validation Dashboard.

**Q: Can I sell memories for fiat currency?**
A: Currently, all marketplace transactions use either SOL or NRAM tokens. However, you can convert these cryptocurrencies to fiat through supported exchanges.

**Q: What happens if my memory doesn't pass validation?**
A: Memories that don't meet validation standards remain in your collection but are marked as "Unvalidated." You can still keep these for personal use or attempt revalidation after a waiting period.
