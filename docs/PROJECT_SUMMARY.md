# NeuraMint Project Summary

## Project Overview

NeuraMint is a groundbreaking platform that integrates brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with the Solana blockchain to transform neural data into tradable NFTs. The platform enables users to capture neural memories, mint them as NFTs, validate their authenticity through a decentralized system, and trade them on a specialized marketplace.
